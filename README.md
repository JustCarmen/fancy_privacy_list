==================

Fancy Privacy List Module for webtrees

This module requires [webtrees 1.7.0](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees) or later. Download the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_privacy_list/releases/tag/1.7.0).

Description
-----------
This module is for site admins only. When this module is activated, an extra menu-item is added to the sidebar of the administration page.

Clicking on the menu link opens a datatable list with all individuals in your tree. You can now review the privacy settings of each individual.

You can view the current status: Living, Presumably still alive, Death and Presumed death or one of the custom RESN tags you set on the individual.

The next column shows you the privacy settings for this individual. Here you can find out who can view the individual.
In the last column you will find an explanation why a certain status or privacy setting is applicable.

You can filter or sort the list. Clicking on a row will give you the raw gedcom data of this individual which you can edit directly. To edit the raw gedcom data just click on one of the xrefs to open the 'edit raw gedcom' popup screen.
