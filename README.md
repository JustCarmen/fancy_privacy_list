Fancy Privacy List
==================

Fancy Privacy List Module for webtrees

This module is for site admins only. When this module is activated, an extra menu-item is added to the sidebar of the administration page.
Clicking on the menu link opens a datatable list with all individuals in your tree. You can now review the privacy settings of each individual.
You can view the current status: Living, Presumably still alive, Death and Presumed death or one of the custom RESN tags you set on the individual.
The next column shows you the privacy settings for this individual. Here you can find out who can view the individual.
In the last column you will find an explanation why a certain status or privacy setting is applicable.

Warning: this module is only tested on my own tree with about 1000 individuals. I don't give any guarantees of the performance of this module on large or very large trees.
At the moment this module will only work on single tree sites. I will add the possibility to use this module on a multi tree site later.
